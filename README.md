# Movies-JS
This is a simple Movie Search App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for movies by title and displays information like the poster, release year, and plot using data fetched from the OMDb API. This project demonstrates how to work with APIs, handle user input, and update the DOM dynamically
